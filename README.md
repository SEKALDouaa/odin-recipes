This project is a very simple recipe website with 4 main components:
-A homepage containing 3 links 
-3 recipe web pages to which the homepage links lead

It showcases different skills such as:
-The complete mastery of the html boilerplate
-The precise and correct use of different tags(such as anchor tags, paragraph tags, unordered and ordered lists tags...)
-The capacity to use images in web pages
